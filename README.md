# README: Adult Income Prediction Using Logistic Regression in R

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on demographic and employment data. The prediction is performed using a Logistic Regression model, a popular method for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following features:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Marital-status
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Sex
- Capital-gain
- Capital-loss
- Hours-per-week
- Native-country

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- R 4.0+
- RStudio
- Required R packages (listed in `Adult_Income_logistic_regression_model.R`)

## Results
The Logistic Regression model predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year with reasonable accuracy. Detailed results and evaluation metrics are provided in the `adult_income_lmg.pdf` R Markdown converted to pdf file for easier read.
